# advent of code (ocaml)

hello! these are my `advent of code` solutions in ocaml.

this (2023) is my first year participating in the challenge while it's still ongoing (and I'm already a day late!), but I do intend to implement solutions for past years challenges when possible.

you can find my solutions in the `lib` directory, grouped by year, or by clicking on the links bellow. 

## running the web server

the `bin` directory also provides a simple https web server written using `dream` and `htmx`, which you can run by using the following commands:

```
dune build && dune exec advent_of_code
```

or

```
dune build -w @run
```

the web server is set up to listen on `https://localhost:8080`
